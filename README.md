![ElectroLinuxLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dogaegeozden/electro_linux_setup_scripts/master/logos/electro_linux_logo_1.png)

Electro linux is a custom Debian based operating system which I'm trying to develop. This repository includes my set up scripts, wallpapers, command line tools, services and etc. 

## INSTALLATION
1) Change the current working directory to Desktop

       cd Desktop

2) Clone the code 
		
       git clone https://github.com/dogaegeozden/electro_linux_setup_scripts.git

3) Change the current working directory into the set up scripts' folder 

       cd electro_linux_setup_scripts

4) Change the launcher file's permissions

       chmod +x set_up_the_system.sh

5) Start the launcher
		
       ./launcher.sh

## BENEFITS
1) Tilix terminal emulator is the default terminal emulator instead of gnome terminal emulator. Which is much more convenient.

2) Thunar file manager is the default file manager which is much more user friendly and easy to use because, it allows users to create files and folders from the GUI.

3) All best note taking and productivity softwares are installing automatically.
